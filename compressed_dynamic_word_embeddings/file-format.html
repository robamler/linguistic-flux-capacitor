        <ul>
            <li>The file is a tree of blocks that are linked together.</li>
            <li>All blocks are aligned to multiples of 4 bytes from the beginning of the file.</li>
            <li>The file size must be a multiple of 4 bytes.</li>
            <li>Essentially, we treat the file as an array of 32-bit integers.</li>
            <li>When addressing a child block from a parent block, we specify its start position measured from the
                beginning of the file in units of 4 bytes.</li>
            <li>Except for the root block, which must start at the beginning of the file, the encoder may place all
                other blocks at arbitrary (non-overlapping) positions in the file. The encoder <em>should</em>
                choose
                block placements to optimize for cache locality on the decoder side, and it <em>should</em> avoid
                gaps
                between blocks unless needed for alignment or for future features (see minor_version field in root
                block).</li>
            <li>All fields are stored in little-endian byte order because WebAssembly (as well as the rest of the
                world)
                is little-endian.</li>

        <h3 id="Root-Block-(File-Header)">Root Block (File Header)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The root block always starts at address zero, i.e., at the beginning of the file.</li>

        <h3 id="Compression">Compression</h3>
        We use an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_numeral_systems">asymmetric numeral
            system</a> for lossless compression. The encoding and decoding algorithms use a buffer of 32 bits, and
        they
        transfer
        data between this buffer and the compressed data source/sink at a granularity of 16 bits. This is why the
        compressed_data field of chunk blocks is of type [u16].
