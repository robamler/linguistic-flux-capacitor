            <h2>What is This?</h2>
            <p>
                This app lets you explore how the meaning of individual words in the English language has changed over
                the past two centuries.
            </p>
            <h3>Try it out:</h3>
            enter the word
            “<a href="#v=0&c=en&w=file"
                onclick="document.querySelector('.app').scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', block:'nearest' })">file</a>”
            into the text box at the top of the page.
            You'll see a diagram with several lines that compare the word “file” to other words.
            Some lines go up and others go down.
            Look at the legend on the right.
            It says that the orange line, for example, measures similarity between the words “file” and
            “database”.
            This similarity stays close to zero for the entire 19th century and only goes up recently.
            So far, that's not too surprising.
            <p>
                But now look at the yellow line.
                It measures similarity between the words “file” and “wounded”, and it goes down.
                Where does this come from, and what do the words “file” and “wounded” have in common?
                To answer this question, click on the yellow line in the diagram and move your mouse towards the year
                1800.
                You'll see a popup that tells you which other words were related to “file” and “wounded”, respectively,
                in this year.
                In the column for “file” you'll find words like “gun”, “marines”, and “soldier”.
                Since English is not my first language I was surprised when I found this, so I searched for an
                explanation.
                This way I found out that the word “file” can also refer to a
                <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_(formation)' target='_blank'>military formation</a> (and,
                by the way, also to the way
                <a href='https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/single-file' target='_blank'>schoolchildren
                    are sometimes told to walk</a>).
                <em>I learned something new today!</em>
            </p>

            <h3>Your turn:</h3>
            click on a different line and move your mouse across the diagram to dive in deeper.
            Click on a word in the popup or enter a different word in the input box to continue your journey back in
            time.
            <p>

            <h3>A word of warning:</h3>
            remember that this is just a tool for <em>hypothesis generation</em>.
            Our language model is far from perfect, so take all diagrams with a grain of salt.
            Most importantly, please remember that all diagrams are generated automatically by a computer program and do
            not reflect political opinions of the authors of this app.
            Nevertheless, if you play with this app for a while you'll likely find something that's
            <em>interesting</em>.
            Formulate your findings as a hypothesis and use complementary tools to research it.

            <h2>
                What Do You Mean With “Word Similarity”?
                <span class='subtitle'>(and what is a flux capacitor?)</span>
            </h2>
            <p>
                The lines in the above diagram measure a very specific notion of “word similarity” that may be
                counterintuitive in some cases.
                Like most of the so-called word embedding models, our model defines word similarity according to the
                <em>Distributional Hypothesis</em>:
                two words are considered similar if they can appear in a similar context.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, the model considers the words “driving” and “walking” to be similar (and indeed, both are
                means of transportation) because either word can fill the blank in the sentence “I am ___ to the grocery
                store”.
                Similarly, the model also considers opposites such as “small” and “large” to be somewhat similar
                (indeed, both are adjectives that describe size) because both words can appear in sentences such as
                “This shirt is too ___ for you”.
            </p>
            <p>
                By contrast, the model does not care whether two words can appear in context <em>with each other</em>,
                and it does not use this as a signal for their similarity.
                This makes sense: for example, the sentence you are currently reading contains the two words “you” and
                “are” directly next to each other&mdash;“you are” is in fact a quite common two-gram in the English
                language.
                But the two words are very different: “you” is a pronoun and “are” is a verb, so we can't even compare
                them.
            </p>
            <p>
                And, since you asked, a <strong>flux capacitor</strong> was a critical component of time machines built
                in the 1980s.
                The term is used here as a
                <a href="#v=0&c=en&w=metaphor"
                    onclick="document.querySelector('.app').scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', block:'nearest' })">metaphor</a>
                since this app lets you travel back in time.
                According to the
                <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088763/" target="_blank">publication</a>, a flux capacitor only
                works once it has been accelerated to 88&nbsp;mph, which is why we've spent a lot of effort on making
                this app <em>lightning</em> fast.

                This app is a technical demonstration of both a natural language model and a novel compression
                algorithm for machine learning models.

                <strong>The natural language model</strong> is a probabilistic time series model that represents
                each
                word by a trajectory in a semantic vector space.
                The model is trained on digitized historic books from the

                An unusual approach in this app is that all model predictions are calculated on the client side,
                i.e., <em>the model runs directly inside your browser</em>.
                This is why predictions appear almost instantly: we don't have to send a request to some server
                every time you press a key or move your mouse across the diagram.
                However, the trained model has about 600&nbsp;million parameters.
                So how can we run such a large model in your browser without forcing a giant download on you?
            </p>
            <p>
                The answer lies in a novel <strong>compression algorithm</strong> for Bayesian machine learning
                models, which packs the 600&nbsp;million model parameters into a file that's just 34&nbsp;MB in size
                (about 0.44&nbsp;bits per model parameter).
                The main idea is to exploit the model's varying degree of certainty about its own parameters.
                Some model parameters are known only up to some degree of uncertainty, and we therefore encode
                these parameters with lower accuracy than parameters about which the model is very confident.
                Such <em>posterior uncertainty estimates</em> can be derived in a principled way using
                approximate Bayesian machine learning methods.
                Details of this novel compression algorithm are described in the following paper:

            <p>
                In this web app, a WebAssembly module decompresses parts of the model lazily just when they're
                needed for some calculation.
                We discard the decompressed part of the model immediately after the calculation so that we never
                have to hold the entire uncompressed model in memory.

                Don't have a specific idea but looking for an interesting semester project?

                I have several exciting ideas for promising followup projects, for example:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    exploring gender bias, racial bias, or sentiment bias over time (see our

                        paper</a>);
                </li>
                <li>
                    adding specialized corpora to analyze how language evolves within a specific community
                    (e.g., scientific communities, courts, or parliaments);
                </li>
                <li>
                    adding more languages besides English (maybe one you speak?).
                </li>
            </ul>
